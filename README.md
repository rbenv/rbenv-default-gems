# rbenv-default-gems

This rbenv plugin hooks into the `rbenv install` command to
automatically install gems every time you install a new version of
Ruby.

## Installation

Make sure you have the latest rbenv and ruby-build versions, then run:

    git clone https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv-default-gems.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/rbenv-default-gems

## Usage

rbenv-default-gems automatically installs the gems listed in the
`~/.rbenv/default-gems` file every time you successfully install a new
version of Ruby with `rbenv install`.

Specify gems in `~/.rbenv/default-gems` by name, one per line. You may
optionally specify a version string after the name, `--pre` to
install a prerelease version, or a specific operating system to install the gem on. For example:

    bundler
    bcat ~>0.6
    rails --pre
    rb-fsevent osx
    rb-inotify linux
    rb-notifu windows

Blank lines and lines beginning with a `#` are ignored.
