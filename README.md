# rbenv-default-gems

This rbenv plugin hooks into the `rbenv install` command to
automatically install gems every time you install a new version of
Ruby.

## Installation

Make sure you have the latest rbenv and ruby-build versions, then run:

    git clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-default-gems.git $(rbenv root)/plugins/rbenv-default-gems

## Usage

rbenv-default-gems automatically installs the gems listed in the
`$(rbenv root)/default-gems` file every time you successfully install a new
version of Ruby with `rbenv install`.

Specify gems in `$(rbenv root)/default-gems` by name, one per line. You may
optionally specify a version string after the name, or `--pre` to
install a prerelease version. For example:

    bundler
    bcat ~>0.6
    rails --pre

Blank lines and lines beginning with a `#` are ignored.

### Sources

If you have default gems you'd like to get from a private or alternate Gem server, you
can list the URLs for additional sources in `~/.rbenv/default-sources` and they will
be added before any gems are installed.
